### What I learned
I think the project definitelly made me more comfortable with CSS, however, the most important thing was forcing me to actually learn animation only using CSS! Before, I touched the subject of React Motion slighly, but this time I was determined to depend only on the basics.

### Continued development
I would definitelly like to continue developing the animations even more, as well as maybe make the mockup more responsive to user's input.
